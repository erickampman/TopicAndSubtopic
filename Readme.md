#  Topic and Subtopic

This project examines:
- SwiftData
- SwiftUI
- Colors (Color vs UIColor vs NSColor)
	- Dark vs Light mode (some named colors automatically change)
- Issues arising from modifying relationship data. 
	- I found it necessary to modify an object's ID if a related object changed
	- ... however, making the ID dependent on text that can be modified messes
		with being able to use TextFields.
- Getting objects to remain ordered in a particular way.
